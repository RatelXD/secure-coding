## Open gate concern

### SEC-2026-001 — Independent review unavailable

- Stage: G1 governance preflight
- Severity: release blocker (not a product vulnerability)
- Evidence: `G1-GH-20260716`
- Why: protected review must be independent of the feature author and release actor.
- Before: collaborator inventory contains only `RatelXD`; `main` is unprotected; the protected `release` environment has `prevent_self_review=true` but only that same account as reviewer.
- What changed: Pages and fail-closed release environment exist; no independent collaborator was fabricated or bypassed.
- After: G1 remains BLOCK and product work is prohibited.
- Verification: verified GitHub REST inspection; see [verification log](verification-log.md).
- Residual risk: deadline risk until an independent reviewer is invited and protections/checks can be proven.
